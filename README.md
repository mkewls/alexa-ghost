# G-H-O-S-T for Alexa

Ghost is a classic word game, where each player provides a single letter in
the aim of spelling a real (dictionary) word, but not completing it. The player
who does complete the word on his or her turn is penalized with a letter from
G-H-O-S-T (just like HORSE in basketball). If a player gets to the T in ghost,
he or she is out!

Some further nuances, which might be considered 'house rules':

1. any words of three or fewer letters do not count toward "completing" a
word for a penalty; and
2. on his or her turn, a player may challenge to
find out if the player on the prior turn has a real word in mind (if not,
the challenged player receives a ghost letter; if so, the challenger
receives a ghost letter.)

## ToDo

1. Testing
2. Certification  

## Long-Term ToDo

1. Use the Alexa-Skills Beta IDE to create a dialogue-based game structure
2. Create logic for Alexa to play one-on-one with a single player at various levels
of difficulty.
